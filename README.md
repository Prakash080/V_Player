## App Features

### Single Page Layout

V_Player offers a clean and straightforward single-page layout. It includes a video player, a text field for entering video URLs, and a dedicated button for loading new videos.

### Internet-Responsive Video Playback

V_Player is designed to provide an efficient video playback experience. It automatically starts playing videos when an internet connection is detected. If the connection is lost, the app pauses video playback to ensure data efficiency.
